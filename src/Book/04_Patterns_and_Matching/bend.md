# The `bend` Construction in Bend

The `bend` construction in Bend is a powerful and versatile tool used to create recursive data structures and emulate iterative processes in a declarative and functional manner. It allows you to define a recursive process that builds a complex structure step-by-step until a specific condition is met.

## Basic Structure

The `bend` construction initializes a recursive process with an initial state and iterates until a specified condition is met. It is similar to an embedded recursive function.

```python
bend <state_variables>:
  when <condition>:
    <recursive_operations>
  else:
    <termination_operations>
```

### Initialization of State Variables

The state variables are initialized in the header of the `bend`. There can be multiple state variables, each with an initial value.

### Immutable State

The state variables are treated immutably, ensuring that each recursive step has a consistent and predictable state.

### Structured Recursion

The `bend` starts a recursive construction, initializing a state and executing a block of code until a stopping condition is met.

### Controlled Recursion

The `bend` construction offers explicit control over recursion, allowing you to clearly define when the recursion should continue and when it should stop.

### Continuation Condition

The `when` clause defines the condition under which the recursion continues. If the condition is true, the recursive operations are executed. If the condition is false, the termination operations are executed.

### Recursive Operations

Within the `when` clause, the `fork` function is used to call the `bend` recursively with new values for the state variables. The number of arguments passed to `fork` must match the number of state variables.

### Termination Operations

When the condition is no longer true, the termination operations are executed in the `else` clause. This clause defines the final behavior and values returned by the `bend` construction.

### Incremental Construction

It allows building recursive data structures by adding layers or branches at each recursive call.

### Flexibility

The ability to manipulate multiple state variables and construct different types of data structures makes the `bend` a flexible and powerful tool for various applications.

### Versatility

Besides creating recursive data structures, the `bend` can be used to simulate iterative processes.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Binary Tree

```python
def create_tree():
  bend x = 0:
    when x < 3:
      left = fork(x + 1)
      right = fork(x + 1)
      tree = ![left, right]
    else:
      tree = !x
  return tree
```

This code creates a binary tree:

- Initializes `x = 0`.
- Continues recursion while `x < 3`.
- Within the `when` clause, `fork(x + 1)` recursively calls the `bend` with an incremented value of `x`.
- Creates tree nodes with `![left, right]`.
- Ends recursion with `!x` when `x >= 3`.

### Example 2: Sum Calculation with Emulated Loop

The `bend` is general enough to emulate a loop by recursively iterating over a state until a termination condition is met. For example, this Python program:

```python
sum = 0
idx = 0
while idx < 10:
  sum = idx + sum
  idx = idx + 1
```

can be rewritten using `bend`:

```python
def loop():
  bend idx = 0:
    when idx < 10:
      sum = idx + fork(idx + 1)
    else:
      sum = 0
  return sum
```

This code emulates a loop that sums integers from `0` to `9` using recursion:

- Initializes `idx = 0`.
- Continues recursion while `idx < 10`.
- Iterates over `idx`, incrementing it by `1`.
- Computes the sum of integers from `0` to `9`, adding the current `idx` value to the sum of the next iteration.
- Ends recursion returning `0` when `idx >= 10`.

### Multiple State Variables

The `bend` can handle multiple state variables simultaneously, enabling complex recursive processes.

```python
def mult_var():
  bend x = 1, y = 2:
    when x < 10 & y < 20:
      result = fork(x + 1, y + 2)
    else:
      result = (x, y)
  return result
```

This code creates a tuple:

- Initializes `x = 1` and `y = 2`.
- Continues recursion while `x < 10` and `y < 20`.
- Increments `x` and `y` differently at each recursive step.
- Ends recursion returning the values of `(x, y)` when one of the conditions is no longer true.

### Recursive Data Structures

The `bend` construction can be used to build complex recursive data structures, such as trees, linked lists, and graphs.

```python
def repeat(target):
  bend n = 0:
    when n < target:
      list = List/Cons(n, fork(n + 1))
    else:
      list = []
  return list
```

This code creates a linked list:

- Initializes `n = 0`.
- Continues recursion while `n < target`.
- Creates list nodes with `[n, (n + 1), ..., (n < target)]`.
- Ends recursion with `[]` when `n >= target`.

### Practical Examples and Exercises

#### Example 1: Factorial

Calculate the factorial of a number using `bend`.

```python
def factorial(n):
  # code
  return acc
```

#### Example 2: Fibonacci Sequence

Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
  # code
  return 
```

## Conclusion

The `bend` construction in Bend is a powerful and flexible tool for defining recursive processes, generating complex data structures, state manipulation, and emulating iterative behaviors in a clear and expressive manner. It combines elements of functional programming and recursive data manipulation to build complex structures incrementally and expressively. Understanding its rules and behavior is essential to utilize the full potential of this construction and apply these concepts to real-world programming problems.
