## What is a Text Editor?

It is basically a type of computer software that edits pain text.

When having the first contact with codes and program skills, skimming through different types of programming languages on the internet is very easy. But something may be missing there, so you start to ask yourself things like "How am i going to code?" and "Where am I going to write those codes?". And it probably is not clear yet. So this guide will try to help you in each and every step of this journey. Coding is meant to be fun, seriously!

First things first, before thinking about which programming language you want to learn (Probably, since you are here, that language is `Bend`) let's think about which Text Editor to use.

There are actually a lot of them, each one has it's own pros and cons, and probably the best way to choose is by testing them. In [This blog](https://kinsta.com/blog/best-text-editors/), there are 13 different types of Text Editors to look.

But, if you don't want to spend too much time searching an "ideal Text Editor", it is strongly recommend you to start with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
"VS Code" is the most popular text editor with the most integrations and syntax highlighting extensions that you can find out there. It's fairly simple to use, and there's a lot of tutorials on "how to use it better" on the internet.

Even so, this is just a recommendation, fell free to choose and use anyone of them.

Now that we have picked our text editor, let's start coding. And as usual, start by doing a [Hello word!](./Hello.md).
